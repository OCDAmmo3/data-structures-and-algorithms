# Reverse an Array
The goal is to take in an array, and return an array in reverse order.

## Challenge
Write a function that, given an array as input, iterates over that array and returns the same array in reverse order, without using any built in methods to achieve such. When a solution is found, write a test function to follow it and test the function for multiple arrays.

## Approach & Efficiency
First thing I did was make the test. Made the test before making the function to solve the problem so that I knew what task I wanted to accomplish before I tried to accomplish that task.
