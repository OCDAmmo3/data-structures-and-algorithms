# Write a function called insertShiftArray
Take in an array and a value then return an array with the value added to the array at the middle index.

## Challenge
Write a function that takes in an array and a value as paramaters. The function should then put that value into the array in the middle index. For even numbered arrays, having the same amount before and after the new value. For odd numbered arrays, having one extra value before the new value. For empty arrays, the value just gets plugged in. For inputs that aren't arrays, it returns undefined.

## Approach & Efficiency
First thing I did was make the test. Made the test before making the function to solve the problem so that I knew what task I wanted to accomplish before I tried to accomplish that task.
