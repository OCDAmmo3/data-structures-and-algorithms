# Write a function called binarySearch
Take in an array and a value then return the index of that value inside the array.

## Challenge
Write a function that takes in an array and a value as paramaters. The function should then find where in the array that value is, returning the index inside the array. If it's not in the array, it should return -1.

## Approach & Efficiency
First thing I did was make the test. Made the test before making the function to solve the problem so that I knew what task I wanted to accomplish before I tried to accomplish that task.
